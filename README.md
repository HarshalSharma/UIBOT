## About
UIBOT is Robotic process automation (or RPA) based basic java software. 
It records user input/output to the system in a file and the executes these input sequences.

To accomplish this task, UIBOT uses [Jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/) which leverages platform-dependent native code through Java's native
interface to create low-level system-wide hooks, further these events are recorded to a binary file in sequential order, which is then further executed whenever required.
